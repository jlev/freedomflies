Installing mapscript

This will require an update to MacPython 2.5
http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html

You'll need numpy, pil, wx: all have binaries on that page

PyObjC and Pygame don't have 2.5 installers yet, so you'll need to download and install those by hand

Mapserver requires all sorts of GIS frameworks, available at:

Get the smaller framework install for mapserver itself at:
http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/unixport/mapserver

You should now be able to open python and import mapscript
