the update method is explicitly called.

    Implements a double-buffered, flicker-free canvas widget.

    Standard usage is to subclass this class, and override the
    draw method.  The draw method is passed a device context, which
    should be used to do your drawing.

    Also, you should NOT call dc.BeginDrawing() and dc.EndDrawing() --
    these methods are automatically called for you, although you still
    need to manually clear the device context.

    If you want to force a redraw (for whatever reason), you should
    call the update method.  This is because the draw method is never
    called as a result of an EVT_PAINT event.
